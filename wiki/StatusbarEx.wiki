=StatusbarEx=

StatusbarEx is an extension for firefox, which can display some useful system information in the statusbar, such as: 

  * Memory (totally, avaiable, and firefox itself used)
  * Network speed (include the download and upload)
  * CPU usage (the system and firefox itself)

To install this extension, just go to mozilla.com ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3271 )

Please note the lastest (0.3.1) is not in public but in sandbox, so if you want to install it, you can download it here: http://code.google.com/p/statusbarex/downloads/list

I don't know when it will be moved into public from the sandbox, but it seems will take a long time....
