=StatusbarEx=

StatusbarEx is an extension for firefox, which can display some useful system information in the statusbar, such as: 

  * Memory (totally, avaiable, and firefox itself used)
  * Network speed (include the download and upload)
  * CPU usage (the system and firefox itself)
  * Battary
  * Page date

To install this extension, just go to mozilla.com ( https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3271 )

Please note the lastest (0.2.22) is not in public but in sandbox, so if you want to install it, you should go here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3271/versions/

I don't know when it will be moved into public from the sandbox, but it seems will take a long time....
